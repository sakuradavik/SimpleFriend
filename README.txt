This is one of the homework assignments that some of the kids in COP3503 had to do. Recently this class has shifted its focus from Java to C++. Unfortunately, I was not affected by this change. I have been trying to keep up with the class a bit and trying to do some of the homework assignments they are getting assigned in hopes of getting more practice with c++.
